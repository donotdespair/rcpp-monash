R is widely used as a tool for data analysis and one of the most popular programming languages. This unit delves into R from the programming aspect instead of using it as a data analysis tool. You will learn a variety of programming paradigms and delve into the foundations of R as a programming language.

## Learning outcomes

1. be familiar with the foundations of R programming
2. understand a variety of programming paradigms, including functional programming and object-oriented programming
3. utilise Râ€™s functional and object-oriented programming systems
4. integrate the concept of metaprogramming to evaluate and construct new functions
