Your task is to create an R package with one of the following objectives:

* Convert between different units of measurement (e.g. feet to meters, kilograms to pounds, etc.).
* Find a word for a game of scrabble or crossword given a set of letters.
* Generate block-bootstrapped samples from a `tsibble` object.
* Generate bootstrapped samples from a data frame.
* Generate random numbers from a Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution.
* Generate random numbers from a generalized Pareto distribution.
* Generate random numbers from a multivariate Poisson distribution.
* Implement a to-do list with dates and priorities.
* Produce forecasts for an `xts` object using an ETS or ARIMA model (providing a wrapper to the `forecast` package).
* Simulate a game of blackjack.
* Simulate a game of connect four
* Simulate a game of noughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe).
* Simulate a game of poker.
* Simulate a game of snakes and ladders.
* Simulate a simple epidemic model.
* Simulate a single-server queueing system.
* Track your own data (e.g. weight, exercise, etc.).
* Track your results in a hobby or sport.

You may also have your own ideas for a package. If you would like to do something else, please discuss it with Mitch and Rob first.

Your package should have the following features:

1. The package should be on GitHub and have a `README.md` file with a brief description of the package and instructions on how to install it.
2. Each user-facing function in the package should have a roxygen header including an example.
3. Each user-facing function in the package should have at least one test written using `testthat`.
4. The package should use Github Actions to run the tests on every commit.
5. The package should have a pkgdown website that is automatically deployed via Github Actions.

For this first assignment, the package does not need to be complete. It should contain at least one user-facing function. You will have the opportunity to improve and extend the package in subsequent assignments.
