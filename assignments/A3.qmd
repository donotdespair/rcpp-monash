title: Assignment 3 (30%)
---

Complete the R package you wrote in [Assignment 1](A1.qmd). The package should have at least 3 user-facing functions, and a vignette that describes how to use the package. The package should be well-documented, with all user-facing functions having examples and unit tests.

The package should include the use of at least two S3 methods (e.g., print, summary, plot, autoplot) applied to a class that you define.

Marks will be awarded for clean and efficient code, and for good design.
