The **randomifyR** package is designed to help you draw samples of various kinds from data sets. In this assignment, you will act as a maintainer of the package, fixing problems that have been reported by users.

You will be given a github repository containing the package, and the problems that have been reported are provided as issues. For each issue:

1. Create a reprex that demonstrates the problem as a comment in the issue.
2. Fix the problem in the package code.
3. Add a comment to the issue explaining the bug and the fix, including a link to the commit containing the fix.
4. Add a test to the package that confirms the problem is fixed.
5. Close the issue.

In some cases, the problem reported may highlight a weakness in the package beyond the immediate issue. In these cases, you should also address the underlying weakness, and explain what you have done in the issue.
