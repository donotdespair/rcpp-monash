title: Assignment 2 (25%)

The **simulatoR** package is designed to simulate dynamic and stochastic processes.

In this assignment, you will act as a maintainer of the package, fixing problems that have been reported by users.

You will be given a github repository containing the package, and the problems that have been reported are provided as issues. For each issue:

1. Create a reprex that demonstrates the problem as a comment in the issue.
2. Fix the problem in the package code.
3. Add a comment to the issue explaining the bug and the fix, including a link to the commit containing the fix.
4. Add unit test(s) to the package that confirms the problem is fixed.
5. Close the issue.

The bug report may not fully describe the extent of the problem, and it may not really be a bug in the package. So you will need to understand what the functions are supposed to do, and then think about why the user has reported the problem. If you believe the problem isn't a bug, you should instead explain the intended behaviour and update the documentation to better explain what the function does.

In some cases, the problem reported may highlight a weakness in the package beyond the immediate issue. In these cases, you should also address the underlying weakness, and explain what you have done in the issue.

> **AI & Generative AI tools** may be used in *guided* ways within this assessment. If you used AI in completing this assignment, please explain how it was used, including any prompts. Where used, AI must be used responsibly, clearly documented and appropriately acknowledged (see [Learn HQ](https://www.monash.edu/student-academic-success/build-digital-capabilities/create-online/acknowledging-the-use-of-generative-artificial-intelligence)). Any work submitted for a mark must:
>
>  1. represent a sincere demonstration of your human efforts, skills and subject knowledge that you will be accountable for.
>  2. adhere to the guidelines for AI use set for the assessment task.
>  3. reflect the Universityâ€™s commitment to academic integrity and ethical behaviour.
>
> Inappropriate AI use and/or AI use without acknowledgement will be considered a breach of academic integrity.
