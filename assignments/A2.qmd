title: Assignment 2 (25%)

[This](regression.R) is a script that implements a linear regression model. However, it is poorly written, and gives errors. Your task is to fix the function (without using any functions from the stats package), write tests, and document how you have improved it.

```{r}
#| output: asis
source(here::here("course_info.R"))
submit(schedule, "Assignment 2")
```
